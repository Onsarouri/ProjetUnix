This is Unix Project, it contains two parts: 
* UDPMODE: the client sends random non-sorted number to the server, which sorts them then sends them back to the client.
* TCPMODE: the client has multpile options: "Get Date and Time", "Get File list", "Get File Content", " Get Connection   Duration" and "Quit". We've made it with two ways:
       - Normal Consol Display
       - GUI Display
